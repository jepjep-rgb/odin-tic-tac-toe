# odin-tic-tac-toe
The project creates a tic-tac-toe game for two human players. It demonstrates the basic ruby knowledge and object-oriented programming concepts I learned on The Odin Project. The project consists of a main ruby file with a lib directory consisting of the required class files.

The knowledge applied to this project are as follows:

1. Ruby:
    - Basic data types
    - Variables
    - Input and output
    - Conditional logic
    - Loops
    - Arrays
    - Methods
    - Debugging
    - Object-Oriented Programming
